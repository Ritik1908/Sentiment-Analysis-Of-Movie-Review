It is a film loved by mothers, grandmothers, and shut-ins who go to the movies once every five years. As a zombie movie, it blows. There isn\\'t a shambling corpse in sight, and it\\'s terribly light in the gore department. \"Zombie 3\", on the other hand, is big on shambling corpses and quite generous with its blood-spilling -- therefore, it is better than \"Gone With the Wind\". It is also not overrated. Most reviewers are under no delusions that it is rubbish. It is, however, not boring rubbish. After a terrorist steals a virus, he drops it while being pursued by a helicopter, and the chemicals leak into the ground. The terrorist, who has been exposed to the nasty concoction, hides in a hotel room where he slowly morphs into a flesh-eating zombie. One of his first victim\\'s is a cleaning lady. Once she\\'s bitten, Lucio Fulci\\'s brand of hell breaks loose. As usual for a Fulci flick, the acting is atrocious, the storyline is riddled with plot holes, and the gore is plentiful. Turns out the film was directed by Fulci and Bruno Mattei, so that explains its rather schizophrenic nature. It is badly shot, too, poorly edited, and the sound design is flat. Still, it is saved by its gleeful adherence to the goriest of murders and its impatient pacing. Definitely worth picking up if you\\'re an undead completest. Or don\\'t like \"Gone With The Wind\", undoubtedly the worst zombie movie of all time.'"},"metadata":{}}]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Text Cleaning:\n\n1.
